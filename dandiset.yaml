description: 'We still lack a detailed map of the anatomical disposition of neurons
  in the human brain. Obtaining a complete map would help deeply understand the brain
  function and provide anatomical information

  useful to decipher the neuronal pattern in healthy and diseased conditions. Here,
  we present several important advances towards this goal, obtained by combining a
  new sample preparation protocol and

  multi-modal imaging via MRI, OCT and LSFM. We perform volumetric imaging of the
  Broca’s Area and the Motor Cortex from the left hemisphere of a single human brain,
  towards generating a cell census for the human cortex.'
