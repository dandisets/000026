This derivatives folder contains manual soma centroid annotation.

The filenames are in the following format

sub-I38_ses-SPIM_sample_BrocaAreaS08_stain-NeuN_SPIM_pos-{pos_z}-{pos_y}-{pos_x}.tif
sub-I38_ses-SPIM_sample_BrocaAreaS08_stain-NeuN_SPIM_pos-{pos_z}-{pos_y}-{pos_x}.marker

Each annotated stack is a [50, 100, 100] ([z,y,x]) shaped subvolume from the corresponding stack in the "fused" derivatives folder,
the pos_{z,y,x} coordinates are selection pivots on those volumes.

The annotations are to be opened in Vaa3D software [https://github.com/Vaa3D/v3d_external], each coordinate indicates a soma centroid.
