Partial manual segmentation of excitatory / inhibitory neuronal somas and blood vessels within Broca Area in SPIM imaging.

Each segmented image is provided as three separate files:

sub-I46_ses-SPIM_sample-BrocaAreaS07_{left/right}_{##}.ome.tiff
sub-I46_ses-SPIM_sample-BrocaAreaS07_{left/right}_{##}_segmentation.ome.tiff
sub-I46_ses-SPIM_sample-BrocaAreaS07_{left/right}_{##}_segmentation_roi.csv

which are, respectively, the two-color acquisition plane, the manual segmentation and a CSV containing ROI coordinates delineating the annotated part of the image plane.

The image planes are acquired using the two (left and right) objectives of a diSPIM apparatus with a [0.88um x 0.88um] planar resolution.
The two image channels are characterized as

# channel 0
Excitation Frequency: 488nm
Staining: NeuN
Fluorophore : Alexa Fluor 488

# channel 1
Excitation Frequency: 638nm
Staining: GAD67
Fluorophore: Alexa Fluor 647

The labels are presented in an "index-mask" format, where each gray value corresponds to a segmentation class:
0 - excitatory neuron soma
1 - inhibitory neuron soma
2 - blood vessel
255 - background

For each image plane the annotated portion is defined in the CSV file.
Each line identifies a square ROI by coordinates in the form

x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max
