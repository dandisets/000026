# VOXEL ANNOTATIONS OF BROCA AREA SPIM IMAGING

This dataset is comprised of pairs of .tif stacks in the form

sub-I48_ses-SPIM_sample-BrocaArea_stain-NeuN_chunk-043_0025_frame.tif
sub-I48_ses-SPIM_sample-BrocaArea_stain-NeuN_chunk-043_0025_annotation.tif

_frame.tif stacks are 16bit monochrome images on the NeuN fluorescence channel
_annotation.tif stacks are 32-bit monochrome annotations of the corresponding _frame
stack where every pixel value corresponds to a single neuronal instance
