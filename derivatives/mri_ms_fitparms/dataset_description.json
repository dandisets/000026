				"Description": "This program takes an arbitrary # of FLASH images as input, and estimates the T1 and PD values of the data for voxel, as well as a linear transform aligning each of the images. The T1 and PD maps are written into <output directory> together with synthetic volumes names vol?.mgh, one for each of the input volumes. All the output volumes are generated in the common (motion-corrected) space. Further information on this FreeSurfer command can be found here: https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_ms_fitparms",

	"Description": "This is a dataset from a Variable Flip Angle (VFA) scan which has been processed through the pipeline described above to compute synthesized volumes of varying FA contrasts."
